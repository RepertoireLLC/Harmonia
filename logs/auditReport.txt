Harmonia Audit Report
=====================

Fixed Issues
------------
1. Normalized user theme colors to guarantee valid hex codes during registration, login hydration, and profile updates, preventing malformed styles from breaking UI rendering. (src/store/authStore.ts)
2. Corrected user presence hydration so new or returning accounts retain the provided online status when synced with the sphere overlay and mesh views. (src/store/userStore.ts)

Remaining Non-Critical Warnings
-------------------------------
1. `npm install` cannot complete inside the sandbox (HTTP 403 to registry.npmjs.org), which prevents local installation of devDependencies like TypeScript and ESLint.
2. As a result of the above, `npm run lint` fails early while resolving `@eslint/js`. No additional runtime issues were detected via static analysis.

Components Verified
-------------------
- App shell routing, plugin registry bootstrapping, and theme token application (src/App.tsx, src/core/pluginRegistry.ts, src/store/themeStore.ts).
- Settings modal sections including plugin manager integrations, YouTube account handling, and escape key support (src/components/interface/SettingsModal.tsx, src/components/PluginManager.tsx, src/components/interface/settings/AccountSettings.tsx).
- Real-time overlays, time display safeguards, and mesh synchronization logic (src/components/SphereOverlay.tsx, src/components/interface/TimeDisplay.tsx, src/store/forumStore.ts, src/store/meshStore.ts).

Dependencies
------------
- Verified package.json entries; no duplicate or deprecated packages detected.
- Pending action: rerun `npm install` outside the restricted environment to restore node_modules and allow lint/test scripts to execute.
