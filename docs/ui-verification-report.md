# Harmonia UI Verification Report

_Date:_ 2025-10-15

## Scope

This pass reviews the authenticated Harmonia workspace, navigation shell, and supporting stores to ensure all primary UI features remain wired and discoverable. The checklist covers:

- Authentication gateway (login/register toggles)
- Header search, presence, and personalization controls
- Control lattice, sphere preview, and operator roster
- Workspace tabs (broadcast, agora, and thread overlays)
- Field notes drafting and archival
- Profile dossiers, chat handshakes, and resonance logging
- Theme customization and settings console flows
- AI integration management plus mesh governance tooling
- Forum synchronization, toast feedback, and 3D scene composition

## Method

1. **Static composition sweep** – `tests/uiExperience.test.mjs` inspects source files for key JSX bindings, ensuring each panel, store, and control exposes the expected affordances.
2. **Store contract validation** – The same test verifies state modules wire required side effects (e.g., chat persistence, AI router hydration, mesh presence management).
3. **Regression harness** – `npm test` executes all Node-based checks, including `stateIntegrity.test.mjs` and the new UI coverage test, to guard against accidental regressions.

## Findings

All targeted UI features are present and mapped to the correct stores and components. Highlights:

- Authentication forms expose email/password inputs, color selection, and login/register toggles.
- Header renders search, friend requests, theme selector, profile access, and AI integration entry.
- Control panel maintains sphere preview, node metrics, and quick actions (profile/chat/mesh invite).
- Workspace orchestrates broadcast/agora tabs and threads; field notes include secure drafting with save/clear actions.
- Profiles surface friend + message buttons; chat pipeline persists to memory and resonance monitors.
- Theme selector supports built-in palettes, color customization, and theme studio linkage.
- Settings modal offers timezone alignment, theme customization, and mesh governance toggles.
- AI integration panel supports connection CRUD, testing, and status feedback backed by encrypted storage.
- Forum store synchronizes via BroadcastChannel/localStorage fallback, and toast stack auto-dismisses notifications.
- Scene renders Canvas, sphere mesh, user nodes, and orbit controls for the 3D environment.
