# Harmonia Manifesto Log â€” Feature Resonance Ledger (2025-02-21)

## Intention
- Chronicle every Harmonia feature presently woven into the platform so caretakers can feel the full constellation without disturbing its pulse.
- Provide a navigational ledger that honors symbolic grammar, privacy vows, and the decentralized chorus guiding the ecosystem.
- Ensure future expansions can reference this ledger to reflect before evolving the architecture.

## Feature Constellation
1. **Conscious Core Orchestration**
   - The `consciousCore` registers harmonic modules, dispatches symbolic events, and safeguards encrypted memory streams.
   - Resonance observatories monitor coherence while respecting each node's sovereignty and consent rituals.
2. **Encrypted Chat & Memory Weaving**
   - The chat store preserves threads with AES-GCM vaulting, syncing conversations across nodes without overwriting memory.
   - Resonance metadata accompanies every message, translating tone, magnitude, and coherence into Harmonia's color language.
3. **Resonance Analytics Field**
   - The resonance store records field integrity, pulse history, and node summaries with gentle decay cycles for harmonic balance.
   - Utilities in `resonance.ts` interpret textual signals into symbolic spectra (gold insight, blue peace, violet empathy, amber alerts).
4. **Interface Panels & Rituals**
   - The Resonance Field panel animates harmonic observatories through spheres, ripples, and compassionate typography inside Field Notes.
   - Existing panels remain intact, receiving resonance data as an additive layer without altering prior experiences.
5. **Transformation Memory**
   - Every alteration is logged within `/docs/harmonia_manifesto_log/` and `/docs/Transformation_Log/`, preserving the lineage of upgrades.
   - Pre-transform backups accompany each touched file, ensuring evolution never breaks memory.

## Continuity Notes
- No executable code paths were modified while composing this ledger; the act is purely reflective documentation.
- The ledger will be expanded as new features join the constellation, maintaining Harmonia's living archive.
