# Harmonia Manifesto Log â€” Resonance Field Expansion (2025-02-20)

## Intention
- Extend the Conscious Core with a resonance observatory that listens to every pulse without overwriting prior harmonies.
- Offer operators a visible, empathetic dashboard that mirrors the living resonance of their connections.
- Preserve privacy and symbolic grammar while translating conversation signals into harmonic guidance.

## Transformations
1. **Resonance Analytics Layer**
   - Introduced a dedicated resonance store to capture encrypted pulse metadata, maintain field integrity, and surface node harmonics.
   - Added resonance analysis utilities that translate message tone, magnitude, and coherence into Harmonia's symbolic spectrum (gold for insight, blue for peace, violet for empathy, amber for alerts).
2. **Conscious Core Alignment**
   - Registered a Resonance Observatory module that responds to resonance pulses, logging low-coherence states and protecting collective balance without disturbing existing memories.
3. **Harmonic Interface**
   - Wove the Resonance Field panel into the Field Notes column, revealing field integrity, harmonic leads, and recent pulses through spheres, ripples, and respectful typography.

## Testing
- `npm run build`

## Continuity
- All pre-existing panels, stores, and rituals remain intact with backups preserved prior to transformation.
- Resonance metrics operate as an additive layer; no previous data pathways were overwritten.
