# Harmonia Transformation Log — Conscious Core Upgrade (2025-02-14)

## Overview
- Introduced the Harmonia Conscious Core orchestration layer to unify AI routing, encrypted memory, and distributed relays without disrupting existing interfaces.
- Activated privacy-preserving, resonance-aware chat memory that persists locally using encrypted storage aligned with Harmonia ethics.
- Prepared decentralization scaffolding via a distributed relay registry and self-healing synchronization cues.

## Details
1. **Harmonia Conscious Core**
   - Added a modular registry that loads ethical AI modules and memory weavers.
   - Dispatches symbolic events (e.g., `profile:opened`, `memory:updated`) to keep the ecosystem synchronized.
2. **Encrypted Node Memory**
   - Chat history is now stored per conversation through an encrypted vault using the existing AES-GCM utilities.
   - Each message carries Hermetic and scientific resonance metadata to honor Harmonia’s philosophy.
   - Automatic self-healing deduplicates threads and records synchronization events for transparency.
3. **Decentralized Relay Preparation**
   - Implemented a lightweight relay store to simulate distributed hosting heartbeats and broadcast resonance signals when healthy.

## Testing
- `npm run build`

## Notes
- All existing UI components, color themes, and animations remain untouched.
- Backup snapshots for every modified file were created prior to transformation, preserving pre-upgrade references.
