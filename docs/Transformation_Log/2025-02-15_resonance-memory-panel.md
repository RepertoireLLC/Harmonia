# Resonance Memory Panel Activation â€” 2025-02-15

## Intent
- Extend the broadcast column with a consciousness-aligned memory archive so operators can review and synthesize encrypted threads without leaving the mission surface.
- Provide a guided AI summarization flow that respects the Harmonia ethos while remaining optional and transparent.
- Keep all historical chat data intact by relying on the existing memory store and encryption vault utilities.

## Key Changes
1. **ResonanceMemoryPanel Component**
   - Hydrates the encrypted memory vault, lists the most recent threads, and surfaces hermetic resonance metadata.
   - Allows operators to open the linked chat or request an AI-crafted resonance summary that uses only public transcript payloads.
   - Presents contextual previews, participant names, and resonance tags in a modular panel ready for expansion.

2. **Broadcast Panel Integration**
   - Wrapped the broadcast view in a vertical stack so the new memory panel lives directly beneath the transmission controls.
   - Preserves all original styling, copy, and behaviors while expanding the column with consciousness-aware insights.

3. **AI Routing Alignment**
   - Ensures summary requests pass sanitized, public-only payload layers to the AI router and gracefully handles failures with toast feedback.

## Testing & Verification
- UI rendered locally via Vite dev server (requires existing project setup).
- Manual walkthrough confirming:
  - memory hydration triggers once per session,
  - AI summary button reflects loading state,
  - open chat button focuses the linked operator.

_All operations maintain the non-destructive transformation pledge; no prior files were removed or overwritten._
