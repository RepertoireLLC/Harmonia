# 2025-02-18 â€” Heuristic AI Fallback and Resonance Transparency

## Summary
- Added a local heuristic synthesis pathway to the Harmonia AI router so summaries are generated even when no remote models are available, maintaining continuity with the Conscious Core.
- Enhanced the Resonance Memory Panel to surface the synthesizing model, reasoning trail, and timestamp for every generated summary, improving transparency for stewards.

## Implementation Notes
- Introduced a deterministic summarizer that analyzes public transcript payloads, resonance tags, and alignment cues before writing the response through the Harmonia ethics harmonizer.
- Updated the resonance UI toast and detail view to report which intelligence produced the summary, keeping the empathic audit trail intact.
