# 2025-02-16 — Resonance Signal Classifier Upgrade

## What changed
- Harmonia now classifies every stored conversation message into resonance families (creativity, equilibrium, empathy, vision, or default) using a lightweight heuristic so memories inherit meaningful tags without manual work.
- Resonance badges inside the Conscious Archive became interactive: selecting a badge reveals its hermetic principle, scientific analogy, and the empathy cue that guides responses.
- The chat window mirrors these tags, showing the resonance label, timestamp, and empathy cue beside each message to keep live conversations aligned with the archive.
- AI summaries receive the enriched resonance context, including the focused alignment record, producing guidance that reflects the thread’s emotional tone and philosophical framing.

## Why it matters
These upgrades close the loop between live transmissions and the encrypted archive. Auto-classified resonance tags give every memory an immediate symbolic voice, while the UI surfaces cues that help facilitators respond with intention. Feeding the AI router a richer alignment layer keeps generated insights rooted in Harmonia’s ethos of empathy, balance, and visionary collaboration.
